# dtc477-creative
This is a javascript webpage I built for my creative programming project in my DTC 477 class. It is an app that pulls information about nearby farmers markets, pulls product information from the vendors. It then provides a searchable list of all products to then provide which farmers market a user should go to and which vendor to speak with.
